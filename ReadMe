Hello, Welcome to F-tech Online Store.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.

First - If you want to use this system really online, you need to have domain and hosting.
If you don't want to pay for domain and hosting, there are also places where you can host for free 
without paying.

Here we will show how to run this system on your pc.

- You must first enter Development Environment(Xampp,Mamp,Lamp,Wamp) to use php code.
   (We recommended to choose Xampp because it can be used in multiple platform like window, mac or linux.)
- Install xampp and then move this code file under htdocs in xampp.


    Login as Admin
      gmail - mega@gmail.com
	  password - mega
- So, you can now start using this program. 
 
For customer
    gmail - kyaw@gmail.com
    password - kyaw

For customer paypal account -> mara@personal.example.com
       pass      -> j<JI33v?


For admin Paypal account -> megahito@gmail.com
       pass       -> megahito


For admin account -> mega@gmail.com
      pass        -> mega




DON'T FORGET TO CREATE A DATABASE NAMING "f-tech.sql" AND IMPORT THE SQL FILE AND RUN.
WITHOUT THE DATABASE THE PROJECT WON'T RUN.
